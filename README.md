# Guess_the_Number | TECHISHANT

In this game you need to guess a number. I made this from python. In this it generates a random integer which is checked.

It uses a while loop and repeats the logic. By using the if statements the number entered by player is checked and the desired hints and captions.

It gives you hints `The number is high` and `The number is low` when the player answer is higher and lower than the number respectively.

## How to Play

 - First you need to type a a random number between 1 to 100.
 - Then if you get a `nailed on the first try` it means you completed the game on first try. Else,
 - Follow the hint and try to complete in less tries.
 - If you completes the game it will show you a `Yeah you nailed it` caption.
 - Enjoy!!
